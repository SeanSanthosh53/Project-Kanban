### What is the Kanban Method?
**KANBAN** is a workflow management method for defining, managing and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It aims to visualise your work, maximise efficiency, and improve continuously.
The Kanban Method is a means to design, manage, and improve flow systems for knowledge work. The method also allows organizations to start with their existing workflow and drive evolutionary change. They can do this by visualizing their flow of work, limit work in progress (WIP) and stop starting and start finishing.
The Kanban Method gets its name from the use of kanban – visual signaling mechanisms to control work in progress for intangible results.

### The Kanban Principles
Kanban is structured to address the human tendency to resist change.

- Start with what you do now – Understand current processes as they are actually practiced and respect existing roles, responsibilities and job and study titles.
- Agree to pursue improvement through evolutionary change.
- Encourage acts of leadership at every level.
- Don't overload yourselves with a lot of work. Stick to 'Work in progress Limit'.
